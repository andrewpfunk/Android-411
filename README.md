My favorite Android apps and things to try

## My phones

In 2007 Apple introduced the iPhone and revolutionized the smartphone industry. I've never owned an iPhone. As a general rule I think Apple comes up with innovative designs and then Google, Samsung, and other Android vendors refine those designs to create superior products.
